# Chess in C
i dont know how im going to build this or give it a UI but here we are. 
The journey of learning starts with the first step

host site on my junky tower i got from the school, install linux on it and do that or something. 

creating it first in javascript through react first then figuring out how to do it in C.
All i can do is create a window and i dont know enough about C to do anything other than that at the moment, all tutorials are in C++ but i hate myself and i want to try this in C.



all: window.c
	gcc -Werror -o window window.c -lgdi32 -lwinmm



## future small projects
1. investigate a way to allow me to upload notes and have it be put into my obsidian note vault (and actually continue to use my obsitian note vault)
1a. obviously it would live on some server somewhere, only i could upload files there, of course bank security may block so maybe look into some ui that allows me to put my notes in there then organize them when i get home
1b. Possibly train AI to organize it for me
2. my own website - cant believe i literally still havent made my own personal portfolio website yet

## big projects
1. Compiler
1a: always wanted to build one, i think it would teach me more about computers than any other project
2. physics engine/game engine
2a. Once again always been interesting in building some sort of game, this could be done in c# as that might be the easiest
3. DIY drone
3a. getting into the embedded sphere, make some sort of microprocesser to allow me to build my own drone or something
